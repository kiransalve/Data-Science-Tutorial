reasons why Machine Learning (ML) has exploded in recent years

ML comes 40-50 years ago

Back in the 1950s-1990s, we had

but that time we have not much data
limited Data – No social media, no IoT, no big databases.

because data not generated 
because internet were expensive
data sharing was difficult.

Expensive & Slow Hardware – Computers were weak, and storage was costly.

that are not capable to run ml model to vast amount data

Now we have great hardwere, good internet availability
and that why we can generate more data 

one study found that
the data genereted from ancient to 2015 
the same amount of data generated in 2016 year only


AI is insert intelligence in to machines

we humans use intelligence like 
pattern recognization, 
problem soving,
creativity,
imagination,
emotional intelligence 

it is very complex

we cant insert this all to machine
because these are not measurable except pattern recognization

we cant make other terms measurable

like equation of love, creativity, fear, anger etc.

In past, we have make AI, 
called Symbolic AI

example - chess game

we get all knowledge from one chess expert
convert to code
it called exert system

but it failed in fuzzy scenario
where some moves are out of range of that knowledge

this problem was solved by ML

it find pattern of data and change it logic

ML doesn't do explicit programming

we give data to system
data have input and output
so now system have to extract rules and patterns
when new data comes
it use that rule
and give output

like detecting dog in image
we give lots of photos of dog
system will learn on the basis of photos

ML is inspired from statistics but not derived from it

Deep Learning use same process

DL are inspired from Biology but its base is maths

certain thing ML not perform well

we have to give featurea to ML

like dog dection
we have to give feature of dog

but in DL 
it automatically finds features

it is beneficial when we don't know features

No. of layers increases efficiency of DL

In ML, efficiency increases as we provide more data
but at certain point its stabilized

In DL performance increased as data comes

But in some scenario ML is better

we cant to use "Talwar" in place of "Chaku"

On the basis of amount of supervision required 
we have 4 types of ML

How to find out the given dataset which type of ML required


-----"Supervised ML"-----

ask data that
is it have input and output column?
means data already have question and asnwer 
and we have to identify relation between them 
for future new value, then it is "Supervised ML"

imagine a maths teacher given exercise to students 
and solved the exercise on board.
teacher says, in exam questions comes based on this, just numbers will changes
student learn patterns to solve the exercise problems 

ask data that
is it have output value numerical or categorical?

if data output value is numericals
like Sales Value, Order Qty, Age, Stock Prices etc

imagine the student who work daily 2 hours study for whole year gets 70% marks
also who study 3 hours the marks will increases
so our output is marks which is numerical 
so it it regression problem

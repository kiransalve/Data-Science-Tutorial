On the basis of amount of supervision required 
we have 4 types of ML

How to find out the given dataset which type of ML required


-----1. Supervised ML-----

ask data that
is it have input and output column?
means data already have question and asnwer 
and we have to identify relation between them 
for future new value, then it is "Supervised ML"

imagine a maths teacher given exercise to students 
and solved the exercise on board.
teacher says, in exam questions comes based on this, just numbers will changes
student learn patterns to solve the exercise problems 

ask data that
is it have output value numerical or categorical?

if data output value is numericals
like Sales Value, Order Qty, Age, Stock Prices etc

imagine the student who work daily 2 hours study for whole year gets 70% marks
also who study 3 hours the marks will increases
so our output is marks which is numerical 
so it it regression problem

if data output value is categorical
like Gender, Product Group, Grades etc

imagine teacher have student data where there favorite plays are listed out of
cricket and kho - kho



-----2. Un Supervised ML-----
aks data that 
is it have only input column, no output column?

ML where the model learns patterns and structures 
from data without any predefined labels.

1. Clustering

Imagine you work for an e-commerce company,
and you want to segment customers based on their shopping behavior. 
You have data like:

Annual Spending
Number of Purchases
Account Age

We can categorize this customers 

High spenders
Frequent buyers 
New customers


2. Dimensionality Reduction

Reducing the number of features while retaining important information.

You have data set for real estate
have columns like 
No. of Bedroom and No of Washroom
so this algorithm will combine them
and make new column 
total_area


3.  Anomaly Detection

It is like finding outlier 


4. Association Rule Learning
find relationships between variables in large datasets.

like if some one takes huggies then they can also milk


----3. Semi-Supervised Learning----
if we have thousands of dog and cat photo
then we have to labeling them manualy 
but using Semi-Supervised Learning 
we will do only some photos label
ML algorithm automaticaly detects others photo
is it cat or dog

simmilar feature in our google photo
if we tag one photo as "me" then all photo that have "me" 
google tagged them in category of "me"



----4. Reinforcement Learning----

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning 
where an agent learns by interacting with an environment 
and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

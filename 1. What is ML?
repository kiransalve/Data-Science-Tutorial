What is Machine Learning?

For Interview - 

Machine learning is field of computer science 
that uses statistical techniques 
to give computer system the ability to "learn" with data, 
without being explicitely program.

For Our Understanding - 

ML is train the system to learn from data and make decisions
The system learns the rules from data.

Explicite Programming - 
We write code for each scenario


Traditional Prgramming - 

Data + Program =========> Output

Machine Learning - 

Data (Input + Output) ===========> Program

In traditional programming, we give input to program, it will give us output

But in ML, we give data that contain input as well as output, we does not write any program or logic

the logic will be generated by ML algorithm

the good part is we don't have to write code for each and every condition/cased, 
it is automatically handled by ML algorithms.

Key differences between Programming and ML

1. Logic vs Learning

Programming: You define the rules explicitly.

Machine Learning: The system learns the rules from data.

Example:

Programming: You write rules to detect a fraudulent transaction (e.g., if amount > ₹50,000 and location is different, mark as fraud).

Machine Learning: The model looks at past fraud cases and learns patterns automatically.

2. Deterministic vs. Probabilistic
Programming: The same input always gives the same output.

Machine Learning: The output may change based on new data.

Example:

Programming: addition of two number, you have to give two number only or program will not work

Machine Learning: model identify from data that the rule is addition, 
so you can give n numbers, it will give you sum of these numbers

3. Human Effort vs. Automation
Programming: Developers manually create all rules.

Machine Learning: The model creates rules itself after training.

Example:

Programming: Writing a program to recognize a cat in an image by checking shapes, edges, etc.

Machine Learning: The model trains on thousands of cat images and learns to identify them without explicit rules.


4. Handling Complexity
Programming: Good for well-defined problems with fixed rules.

Machine Learning: Handles complex problems where rules are unknown.

Example:

Programming: A calculator (fixed mathematical rules).

Machine Learning: Handwriting recognition (varies person to person).


5. Adaptability
Programming: Doesn’t change unless a developer updates it.

Machine Learning: Improves over time as it gets more data.

Example:

Programming: A chatbot with predefined responses.

Machine Learning: A chatbot that learns user behavior and gives better responses over time.


Suppose we are building email spam classifier

It detects whether given email is spam or not

what we will do, we get bunch of emails and find the pattern of spam emails

like if email contains repeated words like "discount" or "sale" or "awesome" 
or email is filled with bunch of images

then you will create a log if else chain for each and every condition

and that will be your program to identify spam mail

But suppose, in your program you have written "if 'huge' repeated 3 or more times, then it is spam mail"

and somehow advertising companies find this, they replace "huge" with "big" or "massive"

then your program failed to identify that mail

then you have to modify the logic of your program

but again advertising companies find this also, they experiments with other words.

In short, you have to keep changing logic more frequently to make sure program worl efficiently.

In ML, it learns from data
so if data changes, it automatically change logic
and identify spam mail more efficiently

This is a beauty of ML
you have to write just one program
and everything  will be handled by that algorithm itself

Some scenario like image classification
you can't imagine how much scenario/condition are there

lets say you want to classify, dogs presents in the picture

there will be hundreds of breed of dog
which varies in looks
few are tall, few are short
varies in color and other many

Can you think how many cases you have to write 
in orderto cover all charecteristics of every breed?

You can't do so..!

here, we have to use the method 
that we, humans use to identify dog

we were taught from our childhood
to identify perticular animal is dog
that one is cat, that one is rat etc

our mind mentally keeps tagging
the name of animanl with there charecteristics

it keeps learning from experiences (data)
